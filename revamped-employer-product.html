        <p>Over the past few months, our product team has been focused on building a new employer experience. With this product release, we will be upgrading all customers. The two major features that will be provided are a new hiring interface and organization reporting. In this post, we will describe both and share what to expect.</p>

<h2>
<a id="new-hiring-interface" class="anchor" href="#new-hiring-interface" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>New Hiring Interface</h2>

<p>One of the major requests from customers is to have more transparency into the hiring process. We heard the requests and redesigned the RecruitiFi product for employers to better review, sort, and give feedback about candidates. All information collected in the new interface will serve as the backbone for reporting by offering visibility into multiple steps of hiring. Let’s dig into what is changing and how we see it benefiting an employer.</p>

<h3>
<a id="candidate-stages" class="anchor" href="#candidate-stages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Candidate Stages</h3>

<p>The candidate journey now goes beyond Shortlisted and Not Interested. The new interface has candidate stages that enable employers to organize candidates while simultaneously communicating feedback to recruiters. Within each stage, employers can advance, reject, or comment on each candidate.</p>

<p>We have made stages purposefully general to accommodate for unique interview processes between organizations and JobCasts. By recording how far along a candidate is in the hiring process, the interface ties your feedback to a high-level timeline. In addition, progressing candidates through this timeline serves as a communication tool to recruiters which helps recruiters build and maintain quality candidate relationships. </p>

<p>Below is the employer view of a JobCast card which shows the 4 candidate stages. Each number represents the amount of candidates in the corresponding stage.</p>

<p><em>Pro tip: <a href="http://recruitifi.com">Learn more</a> about each candidate stage.</em></p>

<p>Here’s an illustrative hiring timeline that shows how interview steps map to RecruitiFi’s high-level stages. In addition to moving candidates between stages, employers could communicate their unique interview steps as status updates within each stage.</p>

<a id="candidate-presentation" class="anchor" href="#candidate-presentation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Candidate Presentation</h3>

<p>Nothing is more important when making a candidate decision than a complete and accessible application. That is why candidate applications will be broken into relevant tabs, allowing employers the ability to access, navigate, and analyze candidates within a single page view. Here’s an example candidate card:</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/unicorn.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Better understand why a candidate is uniquely qualified for an open role. For each application, the submitting recruiter highlights the candidate’s qualifications based on role-specific must-haves. Need a reminder of what the must-haves are? Just click on the ‘Must-Haves’ link.</p>

<p><strong>Profile</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/unicorn.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>This is the heart of the candidate’s application. Employers can view a complete profile including a resumé, cover note, LinkedIn URL, location, and other important information needed for a hiring decision. Candidate resumés will be visible in-line for a more efficient candidate assessment. Also worth noting, there will still be an option to download resumés to review offline.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/unicorn.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Keep track of how the candidate has progressed through the hiring process. Any comments and feedback written about a candidate are visible in this tab for later reference.</p>

<p><strong>Recruiter</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/unicorn.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Scheduling interviews often requires a professional touch. If you need it, the submitting recruiter’s contact information is found in this tab.</p>

<a id="dashboard-and-reports" class="anchor" href="#dashboard-and-reports" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dashboard and Reports</h2>

<p>We believe that data-driven decision making is paramount for successful hiring. We will deliver this to employers through dashboards and reports built upon data collected with the new employer interface.</p>

<p>To start, only organizational admins who manage talent acquisition teams will have access to this feature. Soon, we will release similar reporting capabilities for employers who are involved in day to day hiring. We have split the dashboard into these 3 sections:</p>

<ol>
<li>Candidate Pipeline</li>
<li>Monthly Performance</li>
<li>Vendor Engagement</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s go into greater detail on each of these sections and how they will help make data-driven decisions easier.</p>

<h3>
<a id="candidate-pipeline" class="anchor" href="#candidate-pipeline" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Candidate Pipeline</h3>

<p>The top section of the dashboard reflects information about the active hiring funnel, historical velocity, and stage conversion rates. This section will give you the greatest insight into the health of current candidate flow.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/unicorn.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>The top row consists of six boxes with more detailed information about the active candidate funnel. The upper left box called ‘Open JobCasts’ displays the total number of JobCasts where candidates are being actively evaluated. To the right of ‘Open JobCasts’ are four boxes that describe the total candidates within each stage across these ‘Open JobCasts’. The upper right box shows the number of hires made over the last 60 days. In the future, we will display the number forecasted hires based on our current candidate pipeline and historical conversion rates. Lastly, the smaller grey italicized stats give perspective related to aging within each stage.</p>

<p>Let’s move on to the chart below titled ‘60-Day Candidate Submissions’. Here, we reflect information related to candidate hiring velocity and stage conversion rates. The underlying data is limited to new submissions received over the past 60 days and the stages those candidates have progressed through.</p>

<p>Employers can calculate conversion rates to understand at which stages in the hiring funnel that candidates are building up or dropping off. For instance, if an employer is interested in the number of new candidates needed to make a hire, historical performance can be evaluated. Based on the last 60 days, 10 candidates are needed in New for each Hire (309 New Candidates / 30 Hires). </p>

<h3>
<a id="monthly-performance" class="anchor" href="#monthly-performance" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Monthly Performance</h3>

<p>This middle section of the dashboard helps organizations understand their hiring KPIs on a monthly basis. The goal is to help managers better forecast hires over the coming months given the number of JobCasts sent in prior months.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/unicorn.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>We believe one of the most important employer KPIs is Hire Rate. We calculate this metric with the formula:</p>

<p><em>Hire Rate = Hires / (Hires + Unfilled JobCasts)</em></p>

<p>An Unfilled JobCast is a JobCast that archives without a hire made. This ratio helps employers forecast hires based on the number of JobCasts sent in any given month. For instance, assuming January’s Hire Rate of 42% holds constant, then how many hires can we expect in February? Assuming the average days to hire is 60 days, or two months, then we can expect 15 February hires from the 36 December JobCasts (42% Hire Rate * 36 JobCasts in December).</p>

<h3>
<a id="vendor-engagement" class="anchor" href="#vendor-engagement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vendor Engagement</h3>

<p>The final part of the dashboard relates to vendor engagement over the past 60 days. These 3 pie charts show aggregate data related to an organization’s preferred vendors and the RecruitiFi community.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/unicorn.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>In this illustration, when looking at the first two pie charts, the RecruitiFi community and preferred vendors have proportional amounts of candidate submissions and hires. However, the final pie chart displays the preferred vendor segment having a higher share of the total spend. This means that spend per hire is greater for Preferred Vendors than the RecruitiFi community. In the future, we seek to incorporate other hiring sources in this section.</p>

<h3>
<a id="reports" class="anchor" href="#reports" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reports</h3>

<p>A great dashboard helps users identify areas that need further analysis. Reports will display the underlying data from the dashboard and will be segmented by individual corporate recruiter, JobCast, and preferred vendor.</p>

<h2>
<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We’re really excited to introduce these features into your hiring process. If you have any questions or feedback about the new interface, don’t hesitate to contact our team at <a href="mailto:product@recruitifi.com">product@recruitifi.com</a>.</p>
